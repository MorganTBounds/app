2. Next, enter the proper API credentials (available upon request), and hit "Submit". 

3. You may now enter the URL of a Tweet you would like to classify, and then click "Fetch Tweet". The text from the Tweet should now be displayed. 

4. You may manually alter the text from the Tweet, or enter your own (must be under 280 characters). 

5. When you are ready for the model to classify the text inside the Tweet box, click "Classify Tweet". A bar chart will appear with the model's probabilistic prediction of the Tweet being "Not Hate" vs "Hate".
